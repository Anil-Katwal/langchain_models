## What are Models?
The Model Component in Langchain is a crucial part of the framework, designed to faciliate interactions with various language models and embedding models.
It abstracts the complexity of working directly with different LLMs, chat models, and embedding models, providing a uniform interface to communicate with them. This makes it easier to build applications that rely n AI-generated text, text embedding for similarity search. andd retrieval_agumented generation(RAG)

## Language Model:
### 1. Language Models:LLMs, Chat Models
### 2. Embedding Models:
language Models are used for the chat based application but embedding models used for the semantic search for example RAG.
